# Extractor

*This program is written in Python 3.4.3.*

## How to use:

You would need to install an external Python library called requests if you don't have it already.
To install the library you would need pip and the command for installing this library is `pip3 install requests` or `pip install requests` (depending on which one is associated with your Python 3.4)
Once you have installed this library, follow the following steps to run the program. You can either run the program directly through the terminal. To run it directly from the terminal:
1) Navigate to the directory where the folder for this program is in termianl
2) Now type `python3 extractor "http://sampleurl.com"` or `python extractor "http://sampleurl.com"` (depending on which one is associated with the correct python version)
Else you can do this by opening Python and importing the module in the following way:
1) Navigate to the directory where the folder for this program is in terminal and open Python 3.4.3
2) Import the module in the working environment that runs Python 3.4 (import extractor)
3) Call the main function in the module and pass in the URL as the argument (something like extractor.main("https://sampleurl.com"))
